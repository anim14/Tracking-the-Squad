Trying to tack the internet activity of the Squad in Congress. 
And how their presence/activity is effecting (or maybe not) the 2020 election. 
Are they changing politics? Some say that they aren't politicians, but that they are more interested in changing the system. 
I would like to track twitter hashtags to see what sort of demographic they are reaching.
And also to see if the issues/stories they are focusing on are starting to get more traction b/c of them. 
Are they political influencers who are good at social media or social media influencers who are politicians? 
Search for #thesquad #congresssquadgoals #AOC etc. etc.
